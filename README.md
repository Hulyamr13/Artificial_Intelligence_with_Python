# Artificial_Intelligence_with_Python



The game described above is a clone of the classic game "Minesweeper." In this game, the player is presented with a grid of square cells. Some of these cells contain mines, and the objective of the game is to uncover all the empty cells without hitting a mine. Each empty cell has a number indicating how many mines are in its neighboring cells.

The player can reveal a cell by left-clicking on it and mark a cell as a potential mine by right-clicking on it. If a player clicks on a cell containing a mine, the game ends.

The game is successfully completed when all empty cells are uncovered, and all mine locations are correctly marked. After winning or losing, there is a "Play Again" option that allows the player to start a new game.
